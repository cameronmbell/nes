                           Natural Equation Solver
                                    (nes)

C++14 program to solve an equation seen in photograph; with no dependencies 
other than stl. Pretty sure this program was made by the gang on an episode of 
big bang theory; so credits to them for the idea. I am aware of how ambitious 
it is, so for the time being the goal is to recognise and solve simple 
expressions of the form [number operation number] and others of similar 
structure.

The modules that make up the application are as follows; they are combined 
together in core which also handles the command line interface.

[ho] fmt         better string formatter
[ho] utest       unit test framework
[ho] bytes       endian dependent memory regions
